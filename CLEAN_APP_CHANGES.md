# Clean App Changes & Bug Fixes

## Date: October 1, 2025

### 1. âœ… Cleaned App Data for New Users

**Changes Made:**
- **Removed all sample expenses** (15 dummy expenses removed)
- **Removed all sample friends** (3 pre-loaded users removed)
- **Empty data initialization** - App now starts with clean slate

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/main.dart` - ExpenseManager class initialization

**Before:**
```dart
final List<AppUser> _allUsers = <AppUser>[
  AppUser(id: 'user_1', name: 'Kaushal Savaliya', ...),
  AppUser(id: 'user_2', name: 'Devanshu Sheladiya', ...),
  AppUser(id: 'user_3', name: 'Harsh Kakadiya', ...),
];

ExpenseManager() {
  _expenses.addAll(<Expense>[
    // 15 sample expenses...
  ]);
}
```

**After:**
```dart
final List<AppUser> _allUsers = <AppUser>[];

ExpenseManager() {
  // Initialize with empty data - ready for new users
  _dailyLimit = null;
  _monthlyLimit = null;
  _isDailyLimitEnabled = false;
  _isMonthlyLimitEnabled = false;
}
```

### 2. âœ… Fixed Critical Calculation Bug in Insights Page

**Problem Identified:**
The monthly spending chart was showing **higher amounts in weekly view than monthly view**, which was completely wrong. This happened because:
- **Monthly chart** was calculating TOTAL expense amounts (not user's personal share)
- **Weekly chart** was correctly calculating user's personal share
- This created inconsistent and incorrect data visualization

**Root Cause:**
The `_getMonthlySpendingData()` function was using:
```dart
monthSpend += expense.amount;  // Wrong! This is total amount
```

Instead of calculating the user's actual share of split expenses.

**Solution Applied:**
Updated `_getMonthlySpendingData()` to properly calculate personal shares:
```dart
// Calculate user's share of this expense
if (expense.splitDetails.isEmpty) {
  // No split details - if user paid, they bear full cost
  if (expense.payerId == currentUserId) {
    monthSpend += expense.amount;
  }
} else {
  // Has split details - find user's share
  final userSplit = expense.splitDetails.firstWhere(
    (split) => split.userId == currentUserId,
    orElse: () => SplitShare(userId: currentUserId, amount: 0.0),
  );
  monthSpend += userSplit.amount;
}
```

**Impact:**
- âœ… Monthly and weekly calculations now use the same logic
- âœ… Both correctly calculate user's personal share
- âœ… Weekly totals will always be â‰¤ monthly totals (mathematically correct)
- âœ… Insights page now shows accurate financial data

### 3. Summary of All Calculations Fixed

| Calculation Type | Status | Method |
|-----------------|--------|---------|
| Today's Spend | âœ… Correct | `getCurrentDailyPersonalSpend()` |
| This Week | âœ… Correct | `_getWeeklySpend()` |
| This Month | âœ… Fixed | `getCurrentMonthlyPersonalSpend()` |
| Daily Average | âœ… Correct | Derived from monthly |
| Weekly Chart | âœ… Correct | `_getWeeklyTrendData()` |
| Monthly Chart | âœ… Fixed | `_getMonthlySpendingData()` |

### 4. App State After Changes

**Current State:**
- ðŸ“Š **Expenses:** 0 (empty list)
- ðŸ‘¥ **Friends:** 0 (empty list)
- ðŸ’° **Spending Limits:** Not set
- ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for:** New user onboarding

**User Experience:**
- New users will see empty states
- No pre-filled data
- Clean slate to start tracking expenses
- All calculations work correctly when data is added

### 5. Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Add a split expense** with multiple friends
2. **Check Insights page** - verify:
   - Weekly total shows only your share
   - Monthly total shows only your share
   - Weekly total â‰¤ Monthly total
3. **Add expenses across multiple weeks/months**
4. **Verify chart data** matches actual personal spending

### 6. Technical Details

**Functions Modified:**
- `ExpenseManager()` constructor - Removed sample data
- `_getMonthlySpendingData()` - Added currentUserId parameter and personal share calculation
- `_buildSpendingOverviewChart()` - Updated function call to pass currentUserId

**Calculation Logic:**
All spending calculations now consistently use this approach:
1. Check if expense has split details
2. If no split â†’ only count if current user is payer
3. If has split â†’ find user's share in splitDetails
4. Sum up personal shares only

This ensures accuracy across all views and charts.
